                        E-tickets will be automatically issued by Bangladesh
                        Railway Portal within 30 minutes of successful payment.
                        User(s) can obtain their ticket(s) and also download the
                        PDF version of the ticket from the confirmation page.
                        Concurrently, a copy of the ticket will be sent to the
                        user's email address. However, some mail service
                        providers such as Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook might place the
                        email in “SPAM” folder. Furthermore, it might also be
                        possible that the mail has been blocked by any of the
                        mentioned service providers. However, email containing
                        PDF tickets may be delayed for technical reasons.
                        Therefore, unavailability of the confirmation mail
                        should not be regarded as non-issuance of ticket. If the
                        reservation does not materialize and the
                        client-passenger still wants to try for the same
                        reservation once again, the process will be treated as a
                        new reservation. User(s) can always download the tickets
                        from the “Purchase History” section of the website or
                        “My Tickets” section of Rail Sheba app.

                          To issue railway tickets, Bangladesh Railway Portal
                          depends on different payment getaways for the
                          Card/Wallet charge information. Bangladesh Railway
                          does not store any sensitive information of Passengers
                          such as Card/Wallet details, OTP, Pin Code. In case
                          any Card/Wallet is charged and/or Payment Gateway
                          fails to return the information in due time, it is
                          possible that the passenger's Card/Wallet would be
                          charged without being issued for the desired tickets.
                          In such instances, Payment Gateways will automatically
                          refund the purchased amount by the Client-Passenger to
                          their respective Card/Wallet within 8 (eight) working
                          days. However, in case such a Client-Passenger does
                          not receive refund within 8 (eight) working days, the
                          client Client-Passenger is requested to send a
                          complaint email to
                          <a href="mailto:support@eticket.railway.gov"
                            >support@eticket.railway.gov</a
                          >.bd with details of the issue. A reply to such a
                          Client-Passenger will be sent within 7 working days.
                          Due to the dependency on payment service providers, it
                          might take several days to resolve the issue. For a
                          refund of unsuccessful purchases and card charging
                          issues, Client-Passenger must contact the Payment
                          Service Provider through which s/he made the
                          transaction. For a refund of successfully purchased
                          tickets, the Client-Passenger must visit their
                          respective originating station (i.e., Departure
                          Station from which the Client-Passenger will travel)
                          and contact the refund counter. Bangladesh Railway or
                          Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV will not be held responsible
                          for the non-issuance of tickets or delay of refund due
                          to errors in payment processing or any other reasons
                          that are beyond the control of Bangladesh Railway or
